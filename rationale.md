Rationale
=========

Commonly in literature and other media virtual reality is portraied in negative undertones:
- In *The Matrix* the virtual reality is used to control human beings, providing them with a world at the top of their civilization but hiding the existance of an extenernal reality to them. Humans are used without their concent.
- In *Ready Player One* the virtual reality is a game that has strong economical influence, but a heavy ludic use to it. The virtual reality remains isolated from reality, providing another world to escape the real world. It forms valuable relationships between the diferent users, but otherwise the virutal reality interacts very indirectly with the real world. TODO: this point requires further thinking because the game obviosly creates interaction of the world, but... maybe it is not the intent of the game itself. This interaction is a side effect of the humans using it, not the main intent or use of the system.

Seems like a world where a virtual reality becomes the main and preferred means to interact with the real world, exploring the benefits and drawbacks of such, is seldomly explored.

We can see some of this idea in the current times: design of complex machinery already happens with almost zero human interaction other that the design of the piece in a virtual enviroment. For the reproduction of a design from software to reality we have extracted ourselves, as it can be done fully with 3d printers.

This trend continuing will replace further and further our interaction in the molding of the real world. We will gide machines to do it for us, relegating our task to creating and defining the idea, but not molding the atoms with our bodies.
